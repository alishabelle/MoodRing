# MoodRing

MoodRing allows users to chose two colors on the color wheel. Those colors are then blended together and a mood is generated based off that color blend and based on accumulated psychological data. MoodRing was developed as an interactive nostalgic inducing web app to take you back to the good old days and memories of buying mood rings in candy stores.
